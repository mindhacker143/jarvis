        <li>The growing field of artificial design intelligence (ADI) systems has influenced a major shift in the way websites are designed today. In a traditional environment, the user interface design process is often overwhelming since you require a great deal of creativity to keep it unique. </li>
        <li>It may begin with you and your team of designers sharing their ideas, jotting them down on a whiteboard, and exploring several possibilities and outcomes. Before any A/B testing can begin, the wireframe is set out and translated into HTML so the development process can begin. </li>
        <li>With recent leaps in technology, AI has quickly mainstreamed into the online landscape, allowing designers to combine its applications into websites and create better functionality and user experience. </li>
